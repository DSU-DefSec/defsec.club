At this year's west Instruction and Computing Symposium at NDSU a cybersecurity competition was held for the first time. DSU sent two teams to the competition

The competition placed teams in either a red or a blue role based off a coin toss. In each of the first two rounds, DSU's teams ended up with an offensive red team role.

In the end, the two DSU teams made it to the finals and faced off in a DSU showdown!
